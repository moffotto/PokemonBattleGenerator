#Battling Pokemon

This creates a simulated battle between two Pokemon of user choice. A shinyApp is produced in order for the user to determine how a battle will end by changing the Pokemon stat levels for each Pokemon. The user will also be provided visualizations to show the statistics and math behind determining the outcome of a battle. This uses the Pokemon API to achieve this: http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ .

The user will be able to select the two Pokemon they wish to battle. Choose the Pokemon base statistics and four moves will be randomly selected. The user will be able to choose which different tabsets to see which visualization of the data and calculations of the battle they wish to see.
